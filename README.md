SONAR DETECTION: ROCK VS MINE PREDICTION
1. Sonar detection: This model is basically for predicting whether the submarine predicts accurately what lies ahead, whether a rock or a mine using the dataset which contains numerical values of sonar signals reflected off of rocks and metals and recorded at certain frequency points.
2. I have also compared 2 models in this project: Guassian Naive Bayes's classifier model and Logistic Regression and have plotted the comaparitve analysis between both of them
